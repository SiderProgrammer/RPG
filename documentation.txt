NPCS / ITEMS DOCUMENTATION

NPCs configurations should be added to the npcs.js file located in the configuration folder
Items configurations should be added to the items.js file located in the configuration folder
Several sample configurations are located in these files (npcs.js, items.js)

* configuration pattern *

ELEMENT_NAME_IN_TILED:{ // name provided in Tiled map editor
    //if name property is not given, a static npc will be created 
    
    assets:{ // if not provided, the default image will be used
        image:"IMAGE_NAME_DECLARED_IN_PRELOADER", 
        // it's best to leave it empty for now
        // if not provided, the default image will be used
    },

    movementPatterns:[{ x:X_COORDINATE_OF_THE_DESTINATION , y: Y_COORDINATE_OF_THE_DESTINATION }]
    // after a few seconds of pause at the target point, the npc will start to back up at the spawn point
     // if  we want the npc not to move, leave the array empty, movementPatterns:[]
     // at the moment, we can only provide one destination point, but if necessary, I can add the function of moving to several points one after another


    distanceToDialogue:DISTANCE_IN_PIXELS // example, distanceToDialogue:100
    // if not provided, the dialogue will open from any distance


    // if config dialog is not given npc has no dialog
    dialog: { // dialogue config
      ANY_NAME: { // this property name does not matter, could be for example: TEST, welcome, start, etc.
        say: "TEXT_TO_DISPLAY", // the first message immediately after opening the dialogue
        answers: [ // buttons with answers, there may be one or two
          {
            reply: "TEXT_TO_DISPLAY_ON_BUTTON", 
            linkTo: "NEXT_PROPERTY_NAME"  // the name can be anything but is required to continue the dialogue        
            // linkTo is  the name of the property of the object containing the configuration for continuation of the dialog
            // if not provided, the dialogue ends when this button is clicked
          },
          {
            reply: "TEXT_TO_DISPLAY_ON_SECOND_BUTTON",
            linkTo: "NEXT_PROPERTY_NAME" 
       
          }
        ]
      },
      NEXT_PROPERTY_NAME_PROVIDED_IN_linkTo: {
        say: "TEXT_TO_DISPLAY",
        answers: [
          {
            reply: "TEXT_TO_DISPLAY_ON_BUTTON"
          }
        ]
      },
      NEXT_PROPERTY_NAME_PROVIDED_IN_linkTo: {
        say: "TEXT_TO_DISPLAY",
        answers: [
          {
            reply: "TEXT_TO_DISPLAY_ON_BUTTON"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
}


HOW TO ADD ITEMS / NPCS

go to folder src => assets => TileMaps and open any map you want (.tmx)
if you want to add NPC, click NPCs layer (if the layer does not exist yet, create it),
 press "i" and click on the point where npc is to be located,
 then provide NPC name which will be needed to reference this npc in the config file

 Same process for items, but choose the correct layer

After all File => export as => choose .json 
and File => save (if everything works the way we want)

IMPORTANT! in Tiled, the option in Edit => Settings => Embed Files, must be selected
